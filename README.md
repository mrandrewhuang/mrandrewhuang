Welcome to my GitHub, showcasing several projects that were done as part of an 8-month data science program. In addition, I've participated in a hackathon (see my team's [project repo](https://github.com/RPinkha/June-Code-Jam-2024)) and am in the process of working on an externship program (code forthcoming).

Feel free to reach out to me via LinkedIn or by email!
